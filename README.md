And we are finally done.

### Step 7: Repeat ↩️

You can contribute further by repeating Step 3 to Step 6. Sometimes you will find conflict between your fork and main repo due to other people has make changes to repo. You have to update your repo first by [resolve conflict](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38949951/how-to-solve-merge-conflicts-across-forks).

## Contribute Easier and Faster

Forking makes git workflow a bit cumbersome but safer, you could join this team to get access to push main repo directly. Please be careful on pushing to dev and main branch. It's better to make your own branch instead for safety purpose.

[Access to this Repo team](https://github.com/orgs/JS-Bootcamp-Study-Group/teams/access-to-discord-qa-bot-repo)

You can push directly to dev if you think it's appropriate, but please make new branch for any big update so everyone can test first.
